== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How add separate map for a second gpx file in the same post =
You can create a second map with adding shortcode `[lfh-map]` before your gpx file shortcode `[lfh-gpx src="..."][/lfh-gpx]`.

Example:
`[lfh-map]  
[lfh-gpx src=http://url_of_gpx_file1.gpx ]description[/lfh-gpx]  
[lfh-map]  
[lfh-gpx src=http://url_of_gpx_file2.gpx ]description[/lfh-gpx]`  
  
= Where can I create a gpx file ? =

You can find a website list for do this in the page [Track drawing websites](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Track_drawing_websites).    

[Openrunner](http://www.openrunner.com/) is the best one for me and, most important : this website automatically add the elevation data needed to create the profile.  
You can find on this site a quantity of already registered tracks.  

You can also try the tools on [www.mygpsfiles.com](http://www.mygpsfiles.com/app/), easier to use.

= I have a blank page in place of the marker editor =

This trouble come from conflict with multiple `x-frame options` directive in your server.   
Look at whether the plugin succeeded in writing this following lines in the `.htaccess` of your wordpress application if you can:  

`# BEGIN Lf-hiker plugin`  
`<IfModule mod_headers.c>`  
`Header set X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN` 
`</IfModule>`  
`# END Lf-hiker plugin ` 
	
It resolve the trouble for me.   
You can find more information about this trouble in wordpress support [Multiple 'X-Frame-Options' headers with conflicting values](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/multiple-x-frame-options-headers-with-conflicting-values-sameorigin-deny/)
